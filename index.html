        <p>My experience for the <strong>past 20 years</strong> provided me with skills and knowledge in the area of data analytics and business intelligence. While my experience may be linked to education sector, my role had less to do with
          education but
          more to <em>service
            and solution deliveries</em>. I have delivered the aspirational performance target within targeted timeframe and also achieving a high ranking for the institution to be in <strong>top 10 list in Malaysia</strong>. If ROI is considered as
          part
          of the ranking, the
          result would been within top 3. This was done through a business transformation and change management that was undertaken within the time when I joined.
